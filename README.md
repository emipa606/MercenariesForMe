The Iron Alliance is a medieval mercenary company that is part of the USFM conglomerate and present on your rimworld.
For renting/hiring mercenaries, you can contact it throught three ways :


- Make a caravan and go on their faction base 
- Talk to a trader from an Iron Alliance trading caravan entering your map
- Throught mod like "nopower comms console"



For any payment (bill, incidents involving payments,...) you need to send a caravan with enought silver on "place of payment" which are random place generated near your bases.

**Note** : Medieval gears and armors showed on screenshots come from the mod [Medieval Times](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732569232)

- **Rented mercenary fired** : One of your rented mercenary misbehaved in one of his assignments with a client of the USFM he showed insolence and improper behavior regarding his colleague, he was therefore fired and can not be hired as mercenary again for a while
- **Mercenary want join** : One of your hired mercenaries wishes to join your colony because he likes it, however the regulation of the USFM stipulates that to be able to recruit one of their mercenaries you have to pay 3 times his salary.

To get back your rented mercenaries, it's possible on the USFM Bill dialog you will receive each day 1 of new quadrum, click on the "Show income" then uncheck the checkbox at the right of mercenaries you want to get back.
Or you can also recall your rented colonists by go on the "Hire" dialog and select colonists you want to go back before the end of their contract by clicking on the "Add colonist to recall" button, but you will have to pay the USFM its full salary for the current quadrum.

Dont treat your mercenaries like garbages because for all mercenaries hired you pay a guarantee for each one of them, which will be restored to you only if they come back alive and not wounded (in this case you get back a prorata of the guarantee).

Mercenaries For Me use a monthly ( each 15days (quadrum)) contract system,so the contracts follow the quadrum.
When you hire or rent mercenaries, you create a contract between you and the USFM lasting a quadrum, this contract can be renewed indefinitely at the beginning of the next quadrum when you receive the invoice.

When the contract does not begin exactly at the quadrum start, a prorata is applied to the price so that you only pay from the moment the contract started, so for example if the contract start the day 6 of the current quadrum, you will pay only from 6 to 15 so 9 days not 15 days.
