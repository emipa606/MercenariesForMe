## Coding Patterns and Conventions

The coding structure adheres to standard C# conventions:
- Classes are named in PascalCase, such as `Alert_PlannedDeliveryStuffAndGuarantee`.
- Methods follow the camelCase convention, e.g., `removeSOP()`.
- Use of partial classes and methods is minimized for clarity.
- Utilities and extensions are encapsulated in static classes like `Utils`.

## XML Integration

XML files are integrated to define attributes of mercenary types, equipment, and faction settings, enabling easy customization. The XML files are typically utilized for:
- Defining mercenary roles and characteristics.
- Specifying gear compatibility and requirements.
- Setting up faction-specific dialogues and interactions.

## Harmony Patching

The mod extensively uses Harmony for patching base game methods, with files following the internal class and method structure:
- **Patch Files**: Located under files like `Building_CommsConsole_Patch.cs`, each with classes like `Internal class Building_CommsConsole_GetFloatMenuOption_Patch` that modify specific game functionalities.
- **Methods**: Harmony patches are applied using methods like `Postfix` and `Prefix` for altering existing game methods without direct modification.
